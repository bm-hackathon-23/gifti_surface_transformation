# gifti_surface_transformation
During the hackathon we were asked about how to transform GIfTI surface data from one space to another when transformation information is provided (such as the files generated from registering volumetric image data by ANTs). We provide a code example for applying a set of linear and non-linear transformations to gifti data to map from a moving to fixed space (e.g. a brain template space to new data).
